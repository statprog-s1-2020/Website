## Collaboration policy

- Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively (Homeworks). 

- Individual assignments (Projects) must be completed individually, you may not directly share or discuss answers / code with anyone other than the Instructors and Tutors

- On Homeworks you may not directly share answers / code with other teams in this class, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice


---

## Sharing / reusing code policy

- We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted.

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. Google, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s). 

- Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source.

---

## RStudio Cloud .float-right[ .small[https://rstudio.cloud] ]

- Browser based, cloud RStudio instances

- Provides consistency in hardware and software environments

- Tutors and Instructors are able to drop into your session to provide support

- Local R installations are fine but we will not guarantee support 

---

## GitHub .float-right[ .small[https://github.com] ] 

- We will be using an organization specifically to this course <br/> https://github.com/statprog-s1-2020

- All assignments will be distributed and collected via GitHub

- All of your work and your membership (enrollment) in the organization is private

---

## Username advice

Some brief advice about selecting your account names (particularly for GitHub),

- Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who theyâ€™re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.

- Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack.

- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.

- Shorter is better than longer, but be as unique as possible.

- Make it timeless. Avoid highlighting your current university, employer, <br/>or place of residence.

## Feedback

The content of this course has not changed, but we are trying a number of new tools and approaches for the delivery. 

- Technical failures are inevitable - we will work to resolve them as quickly as possible, but we also need to know when they happen.
  - Report issues with any of the tools on Piazza and/or via email 
  
- Patience and empathy go a long way (for staff as well as your fellow students)

- Constructive feedback is welcome - let us know if there are issues so that <br/> we can correct early
